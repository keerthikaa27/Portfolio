# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built using React and Tailwind CSS.

## About Me

I’m Keerthika Nimmagadda, a 4th year BTech CSE student and aspiring developer.  
With hands-on experience in Full-stack development, data analytics, Python (via an internship at INTRAIN TECH/SkillCepha), and a solid foundation in database administration and AWS architecture, I’m focused on creating clean, responsive web applications.

## Tech Stack

- **React** – for building modular, component-based UI  
- **Tailwind CSS** – for utility-first, responsive styling  
- **JavaScript / JSX** – for interactive logic and structure  
- **Git & GitHub Pages** – for version control and deployment  

## Project Structure

/src
/components – reusable React components
/pages – page-level components (Home, About, Projects, Contact)
/assets – images, icons, etc.
/styles – custom Tailwind configurations (if any)
tailwind.config.js
postcss.config.js
package.json


## Features

- Fully responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile)  
- Clean and modern design using Tailwind’s utility classes  
- Navigation bar linking to major sections  
- Projects section showcasing my work/skills  
- Contact section with my contact details  
- Deployed via GitHub Pages for easy access  

## Installation & Deployment

1. Clone the repo  
   git clone https://github.com/keerthikaa27/Portfolio
   cd portfolio

2. Install dependencies
   npm install

3. Run the development server
   npm start

4. Build for production
   npm run build

5. Deploy (using GitHub Pages)
   Make sure homepage is set in package.json
   Push to gh-pages branch (or use a workflow)
   Your site will be live at the URL above.

Why This Approach:
1.React allows for component reuse and clear structure, making future updates easier.
2.Tailwind CSS gives fast, consistent styling with minimal custom CSS.
3.GitHub Pages provides a free, reliable deployment option.
